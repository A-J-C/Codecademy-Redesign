# Codecademy Redesigned

## Features

Codecademy makes your experience on Codecademy much better with the following features: 

- Adds a new Canned Responses feature into the forums for people who type the same thing a lot
- Redesigns the Forums to have darker colors with more contrast, to strain the eye less 
- Adds a link in the footer to a GitHub repository containing old posts saved from Groups, including many useful tutorials.  
- Makes the notification bell link to your [Discuss][1] notifications, instead of the old notifications page
- Updates the Profile Page, adding 'points today', 'best points day', and best day streak' back into the profile.  

Enjoy the improvements, we plan on adding many more :)

## How to contribute

Push any new files into the **shared** branch and I will merge them up to the master branch.

## Update 

This project is no longer being maintained, due to Codecademy moving onto a new platform.

This repo is outdated and so is now for personal use and isn't set-up for someone forking the code, however if interested please reach out to me.
